    CKEditor is a tool used for easily creating and formatting text on websites.
    It gives users an interface similar to a word processor, making it simple to
    make text bold, italic, add images, and more. CKEditor is commonly used in
    websites and applications where users need to input or edit text, offering a
    convenient and user-friendly way to do so. It's open-source, meaning its
    code is freely available for developers, and it can be customized and
    extended to fit the needs of different projects.

      <h2 class="text-xl font-bold">Classic Editor</h2>
      <p class="">
        Classic editor is what most users traditionally learnt to associate with
        a rich-text editor â€“ a toolbar with an editing area placed in a specific
        position on the page, usually as a part of a form that you use to submit
        some content to the server.

    <div class="bg-white border shadow-2xl p-4 rounded-lg cursor-pointer" (click)="redirectToEditor('Inline Editor')">
      <img
        src="assets/img2.png"
        alt="Card 2 Image"
        class=" object-cover mb-4"
      />
      <h2 class="text-xl font-bold">Inline Editor</h2>
      <p class="">
        Inline editor comes with a floating toolbar that becomes visible when
        the editor is focused (e.g. by clicking it). Unlike classic editor,
        inline editor does not render instead of the given element, it simply
        makes it editable.

    <div class="bg-white border shadow-2xl p-4 rounded-lg cursor-pointer" (click)="redirectToEditor('Balloon Editor')">
      <img
        src="assets/img3.png"
        alt="Card 3 Image"
        class=" object-cover mb-4"
      />
      <h2 class="text-xl font-bold">Balloon Editor</h2>
      <p class="">
        Balloon editor is very similar to inline editor. The difference between
        them is that the toolbar appears in a balloon next to the selection
        (when the selection is not empty).

        class=" object-cover mb-4"
      />
      <h2 class="text-xl font-bold">Document Editor</h2>
      <p class="">
        The document editor is focused on rich-text editing experience similar
        to the native word processors. It works best for creating documents
        which are usually later printed or exported to PDF files.
